Ok now we have a new class , MediaFile, 
what will be the purpose of this class?
IM thinking its only purpose will be to identify and handle the organisation of media files. 
so the separate classes of media files ie imgage class video class etc , wont inherit anything from this class.
It will however inherit From the file class.
I think this is the best way to structure it without overcomplicating things. 
Because from this point we start introducing class attributes.

ok so we can continue from here tommorow.

new class MediaFile will inherit all attributes and methods from the File class.
inherited attributes:
1- self.path - turns a file into a path object
2- self.name - stores the name of the file
3- self.size 
4- self.location
and the methods:
1- hash function
2- getters and setters for name and location
3- formated size
4- __repr__method


the media file class will have all these attributes and methods plus additional ones.



class attributes: an access point for defining media types
instance attributes:
media type - defines the media type of the file (image, video, audio, document etc)


ok this is almost done. we just need to define the 4 media classes
go a bit deeper on oop concepts such as polymorphism and encapsulation
class methods dunder methods etc

we will then go over the whole project for logging and error handling.
then lastly we will create a simple cli first then put it on github
after we will slowly start on working on a gui for the file manager.
